# Conversational-Agent-with-Speech-Understanding
🚀 New AI Project: Conversational Agent with Speech Understanding! 🎙️🤖
Excited to share a project I recently built: an AI agent that listens, understands, and answers questions based on audio recordings — all powered by cutting-edge speech and language technology!
🧠 How it works:
•	The agent takes an audio input (e.g., a voice memo or podcast).
•	It uses AssemblyAI to perform speech-to-text transcription.
•	Then, OpenAI GPT-4o processes the transcript and answers any questions about the audio!
📌 Built entirely in Python, this project is an example of how audio intelligence and LLMs can combine to enable smart assistants, meeting summarizers, podcast companions, and more.
